This directory contains documents, scripts and programs that I often use
for my research, particularly in quantitative genetics.

Feel free to make pull requests. However, make sure first that you work with
the UTF-8 encoding, otherwise:
$ iconv --from-code=ISO-8859-1 --to-code=UTF-8 myscript_ISO.R > myscript.R
If you work on Windows, do this:
$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
If you work on Linux or Mac, do that:
$ git config --global core.autocrlf input
